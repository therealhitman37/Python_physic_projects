This project is a simulation of a simple pendulum, which is a mass attached to a fixed point by a rope or wire of a certain length. 

The pendulum is allowed to swing freely under the influence of gravity, and its motion is described by the laws of physics. 
The simulation includes an animation of the pendulum's movement, as well as plots of the pendulum's angle and acceleration over time. 
The user can adjust the length of the pendulum, the strength of gravity, and the amount of damping (friction) in the system to see how these parameters affect the pendulum's motion.

The goal of this project is to provide a visual and interactive way to understand the behavior of simple pendulums and how they are affected by different variables.
